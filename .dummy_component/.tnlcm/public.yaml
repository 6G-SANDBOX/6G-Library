## Component public variables
##
## Variables accesible to the experimenter.
##
## They are contained inside 4 global variables
## with all required info:
##
##   1. metadata: General information like mantainers,
##      component dependencies and allowed platforms
##
##   2. input: Customizable variables for each
##      deployment to be filled by the experimenter
##      or the TNLCM
##
##   3. output: Values sent to the TNLCM callback to
##      keep track of the TN deployments

# "name" has been removed, "input" was "public" and "output" was "outputs"
# The public.yaml file informs the TNLCM about the component behaviour and how to integrate it inside a Trial Network
# "metadata" includes general information about the component, "input" describes the modifiable parameters, and "output" the return values reachable from other components.

### metadata:
# Gives the TNLCM some general information to provide the experimenter with some useful information about the component's behaviour. Fields are shown in the TNLCM Frontend:
#   - mantainers: Unordered list of active component mantainers
#   - short_description: One sentence long description.
#   - long_description: Description that can span multiple lines. Can serve to component dependencies.
#   - hypervisors: Unordered list of compatible hypervisors for the component. Currently only OpenNebula (one)

### input:
# Describes variables shown in the TNLCM to be filled by the experimenter and included in a TN descriptor. 
# Most variables just serve to overwrite a private value, but others (mainly mandatory ones) serve to define dependencies between componentes.
# Each variable can contain the following fields:
#   - description; A general description of the variable shown in the TNLCM Frontend. "" by default
#   - type: Expected python built-in data type https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp, but it can also be a component name. "str" by default
#   - default_value: In optional variables, the value existing in privates.yaml that the variable can overwrite. "" by default
#   - choices: List of possible input values. [] by default
#   - required_when: Condition to satisfy to make the variable mandatory to fill by the experimenter. Values can be a simple true/false, or a boolean condition https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_booleans.asp
#                    Conditions can include the value of other input variables of the same comopnent. false by default

### output:
# Structure of the dictionary "output" the TNLCM expects to receive after the component deployment
#Â Only keys are checked, the value shown here is a short description only seen in this file

metadata:
  maintainers:
    - Full Name <contact@mail.address>    
  short_description: Short description of a Component Type
  long_description: |
    The long description of a Component Type may span multiple lines
    and provide a more in depth outline of it's purpose.
    This imaginary component needs a previous "X" component to be previously deployed and referrenced in input: "sampleVariable"
  hypervisors: [one]

####################################
## Component input
####################################
input:
  simple_text_variable:
    description: Description of an optional text variable.
    #type: str
    default_value: "Default string"
    #choices: []
    required_when: false

  mandatory_list_of_strings:
    description: |
      Variable has not default and requires a list of mandatory_list_of_strings
      A sample valid input would be ["one", "two", "three"]
    type: list[str]
    #default_value: ""
    #choices: []
    required_when: true

  choose_a_number:
    description: Select a numeric value from the list of choices. First choice by default.
    type: int
    default_value: 1
    choices: [1,2,3]
    required_when: false

  sample_choice_variable:
    description: |
      Mandatory variable taht stablishes a dependency with another component.
      Through the previous component output, other variables from this component can be autocompleted 
    type: vnet
    #default_value: ""
    #choices: []
    required_when: true

  autocompleted_variable:
    description: |
      The value will be overwritten in this order:
        1. Initial value is in the private.yaml file (a.k.a. the value shown in default_value)
        2. If another component was referrenced in "sample_choice_variable" a playbook step will overwrite the value with one of its output variables.
        3. If this optional variable is filled, the final value will always be this one.
      Most cases will be OK simply leaving the default_value for it to be automatically overwritten
    type: "strlist"
    default_value: ["255.255.255.0"]
    #choices: []
    optional: false

## Component output
####################################
output:
  sample_output_variable: Short description of what the output value is.
  another_output_variable: Description is optional. For now, it is unused by the TNLCM. TNLCM only checks the key name.
