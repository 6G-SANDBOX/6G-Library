## üìö What is UPF-P4 SW?
UPF-P4 SW is a software-based implementation of the 5G UPF, a critical network function responsible for handling user plane traffic within a 5G core network. This implementation leverages the power of P4 to define and control the packet processing behavior of the UPF, enabling flexible and efficient traffic management. 

## ‚ú® Key Features:**

* **P4-based Data Plane:** The UPF's data plane logic is defined using the P4 language, providing fine-grained control over packet processing and forwarding.
* **BMv2 Integration:** The P4 program is compiled and executed on the BMv2 software switch, enabling packet processing within a virtualized environment.
* **Open5GS Control Plane Integration:** The UPF interacts with the Open5GS control plane to receive configuration and policy updates, ensuring seamless integration with the 5G core network.
* **Trial Network Deployment:** This component is specifically designed for deployment within a 5G trial network, providing a flexible and scalable solution for testing and evaluating 5G user plane functionality.
