# {{ tn_id }}-{{ entity_name}}

This file is shown to the experimenter after the deployment was succesful.
It can describe its post-deployment behaviour, remind about the input values, or show generated output values.
You can be as verbose as you want: from a schema of the minimal information, to a detailed documentation.

Remember this is a template, so that playbook variables can be used here.
