# previously private/values.yaml
# internal or "technical" variables from the component


# Be careful with conflicts with vars(credentials) from Jenkins and vars from the site repository (mostly site template IDs)
# Variables here (in the case of opennebula) overwrite OpenNebula templates for the specific component (useful with repurposed VM templates for different sizes)


#Â As well as the variables in public.yaml/input, all variables from this file can be overwriten by the input file (tnlcm.yaml)
# However, these variables aren't supposed to be altered by the average user as they can break the Trial Network


# POSSIBLE FEATURE: Experimenter ACL to overwrite all, some or none of the values from private.yaml
