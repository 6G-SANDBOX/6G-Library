## InfluxDB

InfluxDB is a time-series database designed to handle large volumes of event and metric data. It is ideal for applications that require high performance in data writes, such as infrastructure monitoring, log analysis, or IoT sensor metrics. In this project, InfluxDB is used to store and query time-based data, enabling trend analysis, alerting, and real-time visualization. Its ability to efficiently manage large amounts of data and integration with various visualization tools like Grafana make InfluxDB an excellent solution for such applications.
