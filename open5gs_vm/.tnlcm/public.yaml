## Component public variables
##
## Variables accesible to the experimenter.
##
## They are contained inside 4 global variables
## with all required info:
##
##   1. metadata: General information like mantainers,
##      component dependencies and allowed platforms
##
##   2. input: Customizable variables for each
##      deployment to be filled by the experimenter
##      or the TNLCM
##
##   3. output: Values sent to the TNLCM callback to
##      keep track of the TN deployments

# "name" has been removed, "input" was "public" and "output" was "outputs"
# The public.yaml file informs the TNLCM about the component behaviour and how to integrate it inside a Trial Network
# "metadata" includes general information about the component, "input" describes the modifiable parameters, and "output" the return values reachable from other components.

### metadata:
# Gives the TNLCM some general information to provide the experimenter with some useful information about the component's behaviour. Fields are shown in the TNLCM Frontend:
#   - mantainers: Unordered list of active component mantainers
#   - short_description: One sentence long description.
#   - long_description: Description that can span multiple lines. Can serve to component dependencies.
#   - hypervisors: Unordered list of compatible hypervisors for the component. Currently only OpenNebula (one)

### input:
# Describes variables shown in the TNLCM to be filled by the experimenter and included in a TN descriptor. 
# Most variables just serve to overwrite a private value, but others (mainly mandatory ones) serve to define dependencies between componentes.
# Each variable can contain the following fields:
#   - description; A general description of the variable shown in the TNLCM Frontend. "" by default
#   - type: Expected python built-in data type https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp, but it can also be a component name. "str" by default
#   - default_value: In optional variables, the value existing in privates.yaml that the variable can overwrite. "" by default
#   - choices: List of possible input values. [] by default
#   - required_when: Condition to satisfy to make the variable mandatory to fill by the experimenter. Values can be a simple true/false, or a boolean condition https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_booleans.asp
#                    Conditions can include the value of other input variables of the same comopnent. false by default

### output:
# Structure of the dictionary "output" the TNLCM expects to receive after the component deployment
#Â Only keys are checked, the value shown here is a short description only seen in this file

    The long description of a Component Type may span multiple lines
    and provide a more in depth outline of it's purpose.
    This imaginary component needs a previous "X" component to be previously deployed and referrenced in input: "sampleVariable"
