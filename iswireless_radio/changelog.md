# Changelog

## v0.5.0
### Changed
- Variable `one_iswireless_radio_open5gs` renamed to `any_iswireless_radio_linked_5gcore`.
- Changed references to 5GCore variables from `upf_ip`, `amf_ip` to `upf_n3_ip`, `amf_n2_ip`.
### Removed
- Component no longer requires a proxy IP address coming from `any_iswireless_radio_linked_5gcore`. `tn_bastion` now takes care of all the Trial Networks routing.
###Â Fixed
