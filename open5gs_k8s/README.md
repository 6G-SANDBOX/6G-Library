# Open5GS for Kubernetes

The **open5gs_k8s** 6G-Library component deploys a 5G SA Core inside a Kubernetes cluster using the [Helm Chart from Gradiant](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/open5gs/open5gs).
Current versions:
- Open5GS v2.7.0
- Used Helm Chart v2.2.2

> [!NOTE]  
> The Kubernetes worker nodes need a CPU architecture with the vmx instructions set.
> In Opennebula, selecting a non-default architecture for the worker templates might be needed.
