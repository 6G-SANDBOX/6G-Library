stopped and disabled by default:
* **`ueransim_gnb.service`**: gNB simulator service defined at `/etc/systemd/system/ueransim_gnb.service`. Its behaviour is defined through the `/etc/UERANSIM/open5gs-gnb.yaml` file
* **`ueransim_ue.service`**: User Equipment simulator service defined at `/etc/systemd/system/ueransim_ue.service`. Its behaviour is defined through the `/etc/UERANSIM/open5gs-ue.yaml` file

If you need detailed information about what each parameter in the input files mean, check the [official documentation](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM/wiki/Configuration)
